## Assignment Overview

Data structures are needed in Java programming to store and organize data efficiently. They allow programmers to access and manipulate data quickly and easily, which is essential for writing efficient and scalable code.

There are many different data structures available in Java, each with its advantages and disadvantages. The choice of which data structure to use depends on the specific application. For example, if you need to store a large amount of data that needs to be accessed in a sequential order, you might use an array. If you need to store data that can be added or removed frequently, you might use a linked list.

Data structures are an essential part of Java programming. By understanding data structures and how to use them, you can write code that is efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.

Here are some specific examples of how data structures are used in Java programming:

Arrays are used to store data in a sequential order. They are efficient for storing and accessing data that is accessed in a sequential order. For example, you might use an array to store the names of all the students in a class.
Linked lists are used to store data in a linked list. They are more flexible than arrays, but they are also less efficient for accessing data that is not stored in a sequential order. For example, you might use a linked list to store the history of all the websites that a user has visited.
Stacks are used to store data in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order. They are often used to implement functions and procedures. For example, you might use a stack to store the call stack of a running program.
Queues are used to store data in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. They are often used to implement event handling and task scheduling. For example, you might use a queue to store the requests that are waiting to be processed by a server.
Trees are used to store data in a hierarchical order. They are often used to represent graphs and other data structures. For example, you might use a tree to store the file system of a computer.
Hash tables are used to store data in a hash table. They are often used to implement dictionaries and other data structures that require fast lookups. For example, you might use a hash table to store the words in a dictionary.
These are just a few examples of how data structures are used in Java programming. By understanding data structures and how to use them, you can write code that is efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.

The goal of this programming assignment is to ask you to work with these different data structures and increase your awareness of their availability, behavior, and use. Familiarizing yourself with them will help you better consider how you might use them for your project.

## Instructions

## _(Open the Project)_
1. From the **<> Code** dropdown link in the repository (above), download the Zip file to your computer.
2. Extract the files to your working folder
3. Open Eclipse and import the project. 
   - You can use File>Import menu item or right-click in the Package Manager and choose Import.
   - select General>Projects from Folder or Archive
   - navigate into the project until you see the `bin` and `src` folders, and choose *open*
4. Expand the project in the package explorer and find the .java files below the **src** folder.

## _(Complete the Assignment)_

  
Similar to previous assignments, you will use the tester class to guide you in completing this programming assignment along with this programming assignment guide.

___________

## Complete and zip the project
1. Run and add the code to the src folder until the tests are successful.
2. Uncomment each test case in the **Test** file (`TestAdvancedClasses.java`), one at a time. 
Do not modify the content in this file except to uncomment the tests. Add and modify class files
as needed for the tests to pass.
3. Review and refactor any of the code as needed:
    - be sure your code follows good coding practices and coding style and standards.
    - update the javadoc comments at the top of the file to add your name as author
    - update the comments for each method in the file.
4. Export the project as a zip file and submit your work.
